# What have been done so far?

The project contains 5 pages *(views)* that are following the MVC structure.
The pages are:
- login.php
- home.php
- overview.php
- sketches.php
- note.php

Each of them has their own css file and assests/images folder. They are explained in the order of what user will encounter when first time using the site.

#### login.php

#### home.php

#### overview.php

#### sketches.php

#### note.php

# On what have I stopped?

Fixing moving values from form on overview.php to note.php (creating new note with tags and adding it to proper user and story)

# What is there to add?

# What is the plan to continue the project?

Fixed whole road from creating account to adding tags and notes.
